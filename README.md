# Hurricane Simulator VR

## Project Overview

The Hurricane Simulator VR project is an educational Unity application developed for the Oculus Quest 2. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how hurricanes of different categories look and "feel" in a virtual reality environment. By leveraging immersive technology, this simulator offers an engaging way to educate users about the visual and sensory impact of various hurricane intensities.

## Features

- **Educational Experience**: Simulate hurricanes from Category 1 through Category 5 to visualize and experience the effects of different hurricane intensities.
- **Interactive Elements**: Allows users to interact with their environment to better understand hurricane dynamics.
- **Built with XR Interaction Toolkit**: Uses Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit for seamless interaction within the virtual environment.
- **Platform**: Optimized for the Oculus Quest 2, providing a standalone and wireless VR experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Unity Version**: Unity 2021.3.xxf1
